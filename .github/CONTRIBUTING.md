## Getting involved

There are a number of ways to get involved with the development of Stylus. Even if you've never contributed to an Open Source project before, we're always looking for help by identifying issues and suggesting improvements.

## How to report issues

When an issue is opened, a template is provided. Please answer these questions as thoroughly as possible. If we were psychic, we'd be hanging out in casinos playing poker until they kicked us out. We can't read your mind! Please provide step-by-step direction on how to reproduce the issue as well as the browser, operating system and versions of each.

When adding a feature request, please include ???

## Adding translations

You can help us translate the extension on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/github-7/Stylus). When `messages.json` file is ready to be merged, please open a new bug report in [stylus/issues](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues).

## Core style guide

* Use the provided `.editorconfig` file with your code editor. Don't know what that is? Then check out http://editorconfig.org/.

## Getting started

* Then download, fork or clone this repository.
<!-- * Use [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) to run `npm install`. -->
* Make any changes within a branch of this repository (not the `master` branch).
* Submit a pull request and include a reference to the initial issue with the discussion.
