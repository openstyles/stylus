## Getting involved

There are a number of ways to get involved with the development of Stylus. Even if you've never contributed to an Open Source project before, we're always looking for help by identifying issues and suggesting improvements.

## How to report issues

When an [**issue**](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues) is opened, a template is provided. Please answer these questions as thoroughly as possible. If we were psychic, we'd be hanging out in casinos playing poker until they kicked us out. We can't read your mind! Please provide step-by-step directions on how to reproduce the issue as well as the versions of your operating system, browser and Stylus.

When adding a **feature request**, please search through the existing issues to see if it the feature has already been requested, added or rejected.

If not, then provide details describing which page the feature will effect, e.g. popup, manager or editor. Then describe the request and explain how you think it would benefit the user experience.


## Adding translations

You can help us translate the extension on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/github-7/Stylus).

## Pull requests

* First open an issue to discuss your changes.
* Then download, fork or clone this repository.
<!-- * Use [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run `npm install`. -->
* Use the provided `.editorconfig` file with your code editor. Don't know what that is? Then check out https://editorconfig.org/.
* Make any changes within a branch of this repository (not the `master` branch).
* Submit a pull request and include a reference to the initial issue with the discussion.

## Build scripts

See [Build.md](../Build.md) for more information.

## Contact us

If you prefer a more informal method of getting in touch or starting a conversation, please [join us on Discord](https://discordapp.com/widget?id=379521691774353408) or leave a comment in the [discussion section](https://add0n.com/stylus.html#reviews). We will monitor any discussions there and join in, and it may be a more appropriate venue for opinions and less urgent suggestions.
