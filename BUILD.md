# Build this project

## Preparation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Go to the project root, run `npm install`. This will install all required dependencies.

Extra preparations are needed if you want to pull locale files from Transifex:

1. Install Transifex client. Follow the instructions on [this page](https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client).
2. You need a `.transifexrc` file in the root folder. Contact another admin if you need one. It includes the API key to use Transifex's API.

## Generate the ZIP release

Use the following command to generate a ZIP file that can be submitted to AMO or CWS:

```
npm run zip
```

The zip file includes all the files from the repository **except**:

* All dot files (e.g. `.eslintrc` & `.gitignore`).
* `node_modules` folder.
* `tools` folder.
* `package.json` file.
* `package-lock.json` and/or `yarn.lock` file(s).

<!-- FIXME: is this statement still true?
* `vendor/codemirror/lib` files. This path is excluded because it contains a file modified for development purposes only. Instead, the CodeMirror files are copied directly from `node_modules/codemirror/lib`.
-->

## Tag a release/Bump the version

Use the `npm version (major | minor | patch)` command to tag a release.

There are some scripts that will run automatically before/after tagging a version. Includes:

1. Test.
2. Update version number in `manifest.json`.
3. Generate the ZIP file.
4. Push the tag to github.

## Translation

We host locale files (`message.json`) on Transifex. To pull files from Transifex, run

```
npm run update-locales
```

To push files to Transifex:

```
npm run update-transifex
```

## 3rd-party libraries

3rd-party libraries are managed by `npm`. Since Stylus is built with vanilla JS, we only use libraries that can run in the browser.

We keep a copy of these libraries inside the `vendor` directory so users can side-load this repository without executing the build script. These files are downloaded from CDN or pulled from npm (`node_modules`).

To add/update a library to the latest version, run `npm install PACKAGE_NAME@latest`.

To remove a library, run `npm uninstall PACKAGE_NAME`.

After the (un)installation, specify files which should be copied in `tools/build-vendor.js` and run `npm run build-vendor` to rebuild the vendor folder.
